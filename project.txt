Project
--------
what?
A weather dashboard with current weather and 7 days forecast
with different attributes such as Precipitation, UV index, wind-speed, etc.
Search functionality to automatically populate data
-- add more --

Tools
-----
open-meteo API to fetch weather and forecast data
Frontend based in react JS.
Bootstrap React Components
recharts library to plot chart

Features
-----------
Search box to search by location
Current weather dashboard with various info.
Forecast of upcoming 7 days.
Chart with useful statistics

Procedure
------------
Fetch weather and forecast data from open meteo
Design to a frontend 
Use data fetched from API to populate onto the dashboard

Compatibility with own data / raspberry pi generated
--------------------------------
The frontend elements can be edited / tweaked to show
arbitrary data from arbitrary sources as long as they can be
fetched using HTTP calls. The data must be made available via and
API endpoint.
If Rasberry Pi is used, we need a database and an API to serve the 
weather data which then can be displayed on the dashboard.

why no pi? challenges faced
--------------------
While we started working with raspberry pi, the sensors we got turned out
faulty and did not provide reliable measurements despite various attempts.
This resulted in wastage of substantial amount of time, thus we  used the pre-
existing open-meteo API as a proof of concept. 
We found out that useful weather APIs are either unreliable, or paywalled. After
several attempts at finding the right API, open-meteo worked while not providing
the complete data we wanted.

Future works, improvements
--------------------------
Improvements to frontend
using Pi to get real-world real-time data
Using more robust API
